								<h1>About me</h1>
                
								<p>Web Developer | Engineer | Runner | Outdoors | Uke Player</p>

							<p>I love problem solving and design. For ten years, I have had the opportunity to create and deliver a wide variety of engineering solutions in the marine and offshore construction industries.  With an avid interest in STEM and all things tech, I realised that pivoting into a developer role would satisfy the need to innovate, problem solve and bring all of me to work. I push myself mentally and physically. When not coding, I'll be training whether that be at a gym or the great outdoors. I run to explore and thrive on the challenge and camaraderie of team sports. Dragon boating and mixed softball has surrounded me with a diverse group of supportive friends and network. Through team sports, I have gained valuable lessons in working in a team environment outside of the office environment.</p>

							<p>I’m excited about exploring a new career in a diverse sector with the potential to amalgamate; past engineering and projects experience, personal creative and fitness passions and my love of tech. I’m keen to work within a positive, enthusiastic team to build disruptive solutions through design and technology.</p>
