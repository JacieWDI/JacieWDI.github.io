								<h1>About me</h1>
								<p>Web Developer | Engineer | Runner | Outdoors | Uke Player</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I love problem solving and design. For ten years, I have had the opportunity to create and deliver a wide variety of engineering solutions in the marine and offshore construction industries globally.  With an avid interest in STEM and all things tech, I realised that pivoting into a developer role would best satisfy the need to innovate, problem solve and bring all of me to work. </p>

							<p>Completing Engineering and Management degrees from University of Strathclyde and Durham, respectively, has given me necessary skills in tackling any problem whether technical or business focused. With experience of technical engineering positions coupled with project managing roles, in my career thus far, I have gained an eye for detail whilst having a clarity of the strategic bigger picture.</p>

							<p>I’m excited about exploring a new career in a diverse sector with the potential to amalgamate; past engineering and projects experience, personal creative and fitness passions and my love of tech. I’m keen to work within a positive, enthusiastic team to build disruptive solutions through design and technology.</p>
